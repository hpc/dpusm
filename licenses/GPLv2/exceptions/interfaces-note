NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use only the
DPUSM public interface or provider interface. This is merely
considered normal use of the service, and does *not* fall under the
heading of "derived work".  Also note that the only valid version of
the GPL as far as the kernel is concerned is _this_ particular
version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless
explicitly otherwise stated.
